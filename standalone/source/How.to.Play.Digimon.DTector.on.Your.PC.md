# How to Play Digimon D-Tector on Your PC
 
Digimon D-Tector is a handheld device that was released by Bandai in 2002 as a tie-in to the Digimon Frontier anime series. It allows players to scan barcodes and collect Digimon, as well as battle and evolve them. The device features a pedometer, a compass, and a speaker that plays sound effects and voice clips from the show.

However, finding a working D-Tector nowadays can be quite difficult and expensive, as they are rare and often sold at high prices online. Moreover, some of the barcodes that are required to unlock certain Digimon are exclusive to Japan or other regions, making them inaccessible to many fans.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to enjoy the D-Tector experience on your PC, thanks to a fan-made project by Sergio Moya Lara. He has created a PC port of the D-Tector that emulates its features and functions, as well as adds some improvements and enhancements. The project is still in development, but it already has many features implemented, such as:
 
- A graphical user interface that resembles the original device
- A database of over 300 Digimon that can be scanned and collected
- A battle system that simulates the original gameplay mechanics
- A pedometer that can be activated by pressing the spacebar or using an external device
- A compass that can be calibrated by using the arrow keys
- A sound system that plays the original sound effects and voice clips
- A save system that allows you to resume your progress anytime
- A cross-platform compatibility that supports Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS

The PC port of the D-Tector is not yet available for download, but Sergio Moya Lara plans to release it for free once it is finished. He also updates his YouTube channel with videos showcasing his progress and new features. You can check out his latest video here: [^1^]. You can also see some of the sprites he has drawn for the project here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xd1...
 
If you are a fan of Digimon Frontier and the D-Tector device, you should definitely keep an eye on this project and support its creator. It is a great way to relive the nostalgia of playing with the D-Tector, as well as discover new Digimon and challenges. It is also a testament to the dedication and creativity of the Digimon fan community.
  
How does the PC port of the D-Tector compare to other Digivice emulators? There are not many Digivice emulators available online, as most of them are either incomplete, outdated, or removed due to legal issues. Some of the existing ones are:

- Digital Tamers Reborn: A fan-made game that simulates the original Digimon V-Pet devices, as well as adds new features and modes. It is available for PC and Android.
- Retromon: A mobile app that emulates the Digimon Pendulum devices, as well as adds new Digimon and functions. It is available for Android and iOS.
- DMPC: A PC program that emulates the Digimon Mini devices, as well as adds new Digimon and options. It is currently in development for Android.

However, none of these emulators can replicate the unique features and gameplay of the D-Tector device, such as scanning barcodes, using a pedometer and a compass, and hearing voice clips from the anime. The PC port of the D-Tector is the only emulator that can offer these elements, as well as improve them with better graphics and sound quality.
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a faithful and fun emulation of the D-Tector device, you should definitely try out the PC port of the D-Tector when it is released. It is a project made by a fan for fans, and it deserves your attention and support.
